              <p class="aboutCamille paragraph">Camille Lemonnier is a jewelry designer born in Paris, France based in Brussels. After studying at the Duperr√© School in Paris, a space that encouraged her to experiment with different surfaces such as knitted fabric, tapestry or resin, she then specializes in jewelry crafts. The metal oxidation as her first gateway in the industry allows her to tame metal with various self-taught technics, observing the reflection of pigments caused by the melting process. Meticulousness and patience are values at the center of her practice carried by the ambition to root her pieces in time, daring us to scrutinize an unexpected metallic microcosm opening up to our eyes. Today Camille puts into practice her technics developed during years in poetic pieces of jewelry that forms an unprecedented encounter between volumes, colors and light reflection.</p>
